The code in the the supplied jupyter notebook supplies the means to generate the GIF below using ONS mortality rate data.

The following model makes the assumptions:

•	Babies are born to women aged 25 – 34

•	The average number of births per woman in a lifetime will remain constant at what is was in the UK in 2019 according to the ONS.

•	Births are 50% male and 50% female.

•	The mortality rates from 2017-2019 will remain constant.

The model could have been made more advanced using more data for birthrates per age range with more detailed birth rates from the ONS, however the simplification of national average was deemed sufficient for the scope of this study.
